# Film Finder
## Codecademy project: build an API that picks a random movie by genre

**Technology Used:**
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React

Note: Some of the code was provided by Codecademy, but I customized it after finishing the project in my first version. For this second version, I rebuilt the project using React and Vite.
